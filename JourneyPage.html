				<h5>Growing Up Nigerian</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>I was born and bred in the oil rich city of Warri, Delta State Nigeria. I have 5 brothers and two sisters. 
						I'm the 5th child and everyone's favorite. Growing up in Nigeria was tough! I learned about deligene and hardwork from a very tender age. Dad was a marine engineer and mom owned a grocery store.
						My father use to say "Education is the best legacy you can give to a child" wise man! I went to school when my folks could afford my tuition because in my part of the world there is no such thing as "free eductaion".
						Unfortunately, I dropped out of high school after my dad lost his job and couldn't afford my tuition fees. Nonetheless, few years later, I self-studied and passed my GED after a few tries. I graduated with honors from Ambros Alli University in 2012 where I was awarded a BSc in Economics.
