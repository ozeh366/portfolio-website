				<h5>Growing Up Nigerian</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>I was born and bred in the oil rich city of Warri, Delta State, Nigeria. I have 5 brothers and two sisters. 
						I'm the 5th child, and everyone's favorite. Growing up in Nigeria was tough! I learned about diligence and 
						hardwork from a very tender age. Dad was a marine engineer and mom owned a grocery store.
						My father use to say "Education is the best legacy you can give to a child" wise man! I went to school 
						when my folks could afford my tuition because in my part of the world there is no such thing as
						 "free eductaion". Unfortunately, I dropped out of high school after my dad lost his job and couldn't afford my tuition. 
						 Nonetheless, I self-studied and earned my GED after a few tries. I graduated with honors from Ambrose Alli University in 2012 where I was awarded a BSc in Economics.

				<h5>The Great Transition</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>My insatiable thirst for knowledge motivated me to relocate to the U.S to further my education in 2014. 
						When I arrived in New York, I instantly knew that I was destined to be here.
						The euphoria of arriving in a new country was short lived because I was on a mission to be great.
						 I decided to enlist in the military in an attempt to contribute to this nation that 
						has transformed the lives of so many immigrants like myself. 
						I received tuition assistance and other amazing benefits while serving as an active duty Soldier. 
						I graduated with honors from Murray State University in 2020. I was awarded an MBA with a concentration 
						in healthcare administration. God is good!

				<h5>Creating My Future</h5>
				<div class="pra">
					<p>As I reminisce on my journey thus far, I am excited about what God has in store for me. 
						I left active duty military in 2021 after the untimely demise of my lovely spouse to pursue a career in IT. 
						 I work for an IT company as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). I am passionate
						  about ensuring that our end-users have the best user experience hence my decision to become a 
						  full stack software developer
						 so I can be closer to the software achitecture. Finally, I want to use this medium to thank God,
						  my family and my late spouse (melaneice) for having my back all these years. The marathon continues!
